## MTA Tweet Analysis
New Yorkers love to tweet about the transit system and its many shortcomings. This project aims to analyze tweets about the MTA, to visualize and understand what and where people's concerns are.

Currently, it parses and analyzes an archive of tweets from the past year, tagged with the hashtag '#MTAFail'. It outputs a map of geo-tagged tweets, lists of other popular hashtags and users. It also outputs word vectors corresponding to specific streets or avenues and noun phrases for further natural language processing.
